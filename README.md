# water_restoration_in_maji_ndogo
Maji Ndogo, once a community with abundant water resources, faced a severe water scarcity crisis due to a prolonged drought and inefficient resource management. To address this critical issue, a data-driven approach was implemented.

A comprehensive water survey was conducted throughout Maji Ndogo to assess existing water sources, identify areas of need, and map the community's water consumption patterns. The collected data provided valuable insights into the crisis, enabling informed decision-making and the development of a sustainable water restoration plan.

By leveraging data, Maji Ndogo was able to prioritize water restoration efforts, allocate resources effectively, and ensure that clean water was delivered to the community in the most economical and efficient manner possible.
